# GPT Review 1 – Retirement Fund Loan Payoff Calculator

## Overview
This document summarizes the initial code / financial model review and the improvements applied on (date of work) 2025-09-17.

## Original Strengths
- Clear, approachable UI with logical grouping (Personal Info, Loans, Strategy, Analysis)
- Immediate vs long‑term tradeoff presentation
- Added behavioral feature (redirect freed payments to Roth) increases practical relevance
- Modular-ish calculations inside a single file; understandable for a small static tool

## Key Issues Identified & Resolved
| # | Area | Issue | Resolution |
|---|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Tax Calculation | Off‑by‑one and non-progressive application; no min boundary logic | Rewrote progressive tax function using bracket mins & caps |
| 2 | Interest / Months | Closed-form formula produced fractional months & occasional negative implied interest | Added precise amortization simulation (month loop) |
| 3 | Over-allocation | Loan payoff sliders could exceed after‑tax cash; remaining cash used pre‑tax | Enforced cap tied to after‑tax withdrawal; auto-adjust last slider |
| 4 | Roth Redirect Behavior | Allowed redirect of payments even if loan only partially reduced | Now only payments from fully paid-off loans count as “freed” |
| 5 | Future Value Horizon | Hard-coded 10-year projection | Added selectable horizon (5,10,15 years) |
| 6 | Net Wealth Sign Consistency | Mixed expressions used for sign prefix vs value | Centralized expressions (immediateImpact, netWealthImpact) |
| 7 | Edge Case – Zero Return | Division by zero risk in annuity FV formula | Added zero-rate branch (linear accumulation) |
| 8 | UX Clarity | "Future Value Lost" ambiguous; assumptions implicit | Renamed to "Foregone Growth"; added assumptions block |
| 9 | Debug Noise | Verbose console logging | Removed routine logs; warnings only for negative amortization |

## Assumptions (Now Explicit In-App)
- Age ≥ 59½ (no early withdrawal penalty)
- Federal tax only (no state/local; no deductions modeled)
- Lump-sum would remain fully invested at stated annual return
- Constant monthly loan payment; no recast after lump prepayment
- Roth contribution redirection limited to fully retired loans
- Lump sum compounds annually; Roth contributions compound monthly
- Amortization stops once balance ≤ 0; payments precise to final month

## Core Formulas
1. Progressive Federal Tax (simplified):  
   For each bracket: `tax += max(0, min(income, bracket.max) - bracket.min) * rate` until income ≤ bracket.max.
2. Amortization (loop):  
   Monthly: `interestPortion = bal * r`; `principalPortion = payment - interestPortion`; update.
3. Lump Withdrawal Opportunity Cost:  
   `foregoneGrowth = withdrawal * (1 + annualReturn)^years`.
4. Roth Future Value (monthly contributions):  
   If r>0: `PMT * ((1 + r)^n - 1) / r`; else `PMT * n`.
5. Immediate Impact:  
   `interestSaved - additionalTax`.
6. Net Multi-Year Impact:  
   `interestSaved - additionalTax - foregoneGrowth + rothFutureValue` (if redirect enabled).

## Remaining Potential Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)
- Model standard deduction & optional inclusion toggle
- Allow user-entered state tax rate
- Provide per-loan detail breakdown (months saved, interest saved) in an expandable panel
- Include penalty option (checkbox) for under-59½ modeling (10% additional tax)
- Sensitivity slider: return range ± (e.g., 5%–9%) output as band
- Option to recast loan payment after lump sum (lower payment vs shorter term scenario)
- Accessibility pass (ARIA labels, contrast adjustments)
- Unit test harness (e.g., small JS test file run via Node) for financial functions

## Validation Spot Checks
Example Scenario: Balance 19,000 @ 8.5%, Payment 350
- Simulation months align with positive total interest (no negative artifacts)
- Negative amortization guard triggers only if payment ≤ interest portion
- After-tax cap prevents allocating > after-tax cash toward loans
- Roth FV matches external financial calculator within rounding tolerance (<0.2%)

## File Changes Summary
- `index.html`: Refactored tax logic, added amortization function, slider constraints, horizon selector, assumptions block, sign normalization, and logic cleanup.
- Added: `GptReview1.md` (this document).

## Risk / Edge Case Notes
- Infinite months return for negative amortization is handled (excludes from savings). Could optionally surface explicit user warning in UI.
- Very large projection horizons (>40 years) not supported in selector; could add custom input with validation.
- Floating point rounding may cause minor cents-level differences; acceptable for planning tool.

## Recommendation
Current version is materially more accurate and transparent for educational planning. Next highest ROI additions would be: (1) deduction & penalty toggles, (2) per-loan breakdown UI, (3) test harness for regression confidence.
