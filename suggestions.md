# Retirement Fund Loan Payoff Calculator - Usability Suggestions

Here are usability questions and observations worth considering for future improvements:

## âœ… Completed Items

- **âœ… Export CSV button** â€“ CSV export functionality now fully implemented with comprehensive data export
- **âœ… Loan sliders default to full balance** â€“ Now default to 0 (opt-in) to avoid accidental full-payoff assumptions  
- **âœ… Roth redirect slider** â€“ Now properly disabled until â‰¥1 loan fully paid to prevent confusion when no payments are freed
- **âœ… Remaining cash negative clamp** â€“ Remaining cash now clamped to $0 minimum to prevent confusing negative display
- **âœ… Market timing scenario indicator** â€“ Added visual badge when Net Impact uses market correction scenario  
- **âœ… Shrink to needed button** â€“ Added quick-fix button for over-withdrawal warnings
- **âœ… Accessibility** â€“ Numeric inputs now implemented alongside all sliders for precise values and keyboard accessibility

## ðŸ”„ Outstanding Suggestions

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Hidden placeholders** â€“ Many `/* Lines xxx omitted */` spots (loan inputs, deduction panel, market timing options, Roth details) look like redacted code. Are those actually rendering in the live app, or are key controls currently missing?

### Calculation & Display

- **Infinity safeguards** â€“ Negative amortization returns `{ months: Infinity }`; do you want a visible inline warning per affected loan (some code path collects a warning but the UI snippet for loan breakdown rows is omitted)?

- **Breakeven explanation** â€“ Breakeven calc labels "(no growth)" but foregone growth is a major factor; do you want a second "growth-adjusted breakeven" or to clarify label?



- **State tax model** â€“ Flat-rate applied to full withdrawal may mislead; do you want a tooltip hint that progressive state systems aren't modeled?



- **Large projection years** â€“ 30-year foregone growth numbers can dwarf everything; consider a subtle "scale / logarithmic view" or sensitivity toggle?

### Advanced Features

- **Roth withdrawal assumption** â€“ You state "assumes withdrawing contributions only"; do you need an optional field for "portion is earnings" to model taxes/penalty edge cases?

- **Scenario saving** â€“ LocalStorage only: should you surface capacity/clear-all/manage scenarios UI (delete button)?
